Import, export and edit patterns with the Block Pattern custom post type with additional settings and UI features that makes working with WordPress block patterns easier and faster

== Description ==

Pattern Editor is a plugin to help you create and edit patterns for the WordPress block editor. It registers a new post type called "Pattern" that allows you to create and edit patterns in the same way you would create and edit posts.

The pattern editor allows you to edit patterns separately as if they were pages. Patterns can also be saved directly to the active child theme which can enable a really powerful design system for theme developers once in place.

More documentation coming soon.
